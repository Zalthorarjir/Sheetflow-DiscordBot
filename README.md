Sheetflow is a Discordbot build on Python.

Its made to Send, Approve, And update uploaded Character sheets for Discord Roleplay.
Making Adaptations of this bot is highly encouraged!

A few key features or optional changes might be missing currently:

- Generalization outside of Roleplay uses.
- Webpage integrations.
- BugFixes if Any are in the script.
- Possibly more.

The code is Fully Open-Source, And should stay Open-Source.
