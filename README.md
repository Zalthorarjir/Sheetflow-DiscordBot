Sheetflow is a Discord bot built on Python.

It's made to send, approve, and update uploaded character sheets for Discord roleplay.
Making adaptations of this bot is highly encouraged!

A few key features or optional changes might be missing currently:

- Generalization outside of roleplay uses.
- Webpage integrations.
- Bug fixes if any are in the script.
- Possibly more.

The code is fully open-source and should stay open-source.

Any questions, advice, etc.?

Comments, bug reports, etc. posted here on GitHub will either have a huge delayed response time or not be responded to at all.
