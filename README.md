Sheetflow is a Discord bot built on Python.

It's made to send, approve, and update uploaded character sheets for Discord roleplay.
Making adaptations of this bot is highly encouraged!

A few key features or changes might be comming **in the far future:**

- Generalization outside of roleplay uses.
- Webpage integrations.
- Bug fixes if any are in the script.
- Possibly more.

The code is fully open-source and should stay open-source.

**WHATS NEW:**
Currency system with integrated shop, add as many custom items as you like!

**RP/DND:**
- Healthbar 
- (Can hold all the hearts you can carry.)
- Combat Attack result randomizers 
- (Define your own probabilities with a command.)
- Inventory system 
- (Loot Goblins untite!)
- Item trading for currency 
- (Booming business!)
- Shop system 
- (Caching!)
- Work 
- (Work it baby! Comes with customizable min and max amounts.)

**Issues or tweaks planned:**

- Consumable shop and Normal shop seperation. 
(Also making items useable.)
- Update command name logics 
(Infuriating me too trust me, its useable not really easy to find and familiarize.)
- Add a database for some settings to be remembered like the probability of Combat randomizers. 
(Databases suck okay? updated asap.)
